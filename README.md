Developed a Breast Cancer Prediction model using Random Forest Classifier. The model achieved high accuracy by preprocessing the dataset with EDA, data visualization, and feature scaling. Evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. The project demonstrates my expertise in machine learning, model training, and evaluation.
